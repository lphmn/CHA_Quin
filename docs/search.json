    "text": "Introduction\nThe Quin County Community Health Board (Quin CHB), governed by five members, is a multi-county community health services (CHS) entity responsible for providing local governmental public health services. Through delegation and sharing agreements, all powers and duties are delegated to the health departments of Kittson County Public Health, Marshall County Public Health, Pennington-Red Lake County Public Health, and Roseau County Public Health. We are pleased to share the 2023-2025 preliminary Community Health Assessment (CHA) to gain deeper insights into the health challenges affecting these communities..\nQuin CHB is going to utilized an adapted version of the Community Health Improvement Framework, “Mobilizing Action for Planning and Partnership” (MAPP), to collect information and create a Community Health Assessment (CHA) that highlights the most critical health needs within the service area. The data collection process faced limitations due to the availability of county-level data, community input, survey responses, and time constraints. This framework facilitated structured and focused discussions, incorporating data analysis, participant feedback, potential solutions, and agreed-upon future strategies among community health partners.\nThe CHA findings are instrumental in pinpointing, developing, and targeting strategies to address health challenges within the community. Guided by public health leaders and strategists, this framework, combined with Results Based Accountability, enables communities to apply strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify community-driven solutions and resources for collective action. The Community Health Assessment is designed to be a living document, updated as new data becomes available. We encourage using this assessment as a foundation for understanding our communities’ health, enhancing well-being, and planning for the future.",

    "text": "Rationale Behind Our Choices\nIn today’s world, we can easily experience information overload. The Census Bureau alone provides millions of data points available for public use. If we use all the available Census Bureau data, our Community Health Assessment (CHA) would not be meaningful because we would be overwhelmed with data. Additionally, relying solely on one data source like the Census Bureau would cause us to miss important details provided by other high-quality sources.\nThe art of data involves reducing noise (achieving consistency or understanding the reasons for inconsistencies among different data sources). By reducing noise, we can better identify high-quality sources that provide the essential components for a comprehensive CHA. We aimed to select outcomes of interest that provide trend data (evaluated over multiple years) to track our historical performance and improvements in key areas. However, some outcomes are only shown for one year because they may be projected outcomes (based on statistical models) or the outcome definition changed over time, making it inappropriate/unreliable to display them over multiple years.\nWe used the most up-to-date publicly available data for the following reasons:\nAn important note for our CHA is that, due to the small populations in our five counties, we can’t always examine multiple factors at the same time. We know that health is affected by many things, but we don’t always have detailed information or enough people to break down the data in many ways. For example, if we wanted to study lung cancer and compare it between men and women, we might not have enough data to do this accurately because there aren’t enough people. While we might have enough data to look at rates of lung cancer for each county, we might not be able to analyze lung cancer rates by birth sex.",

This is similar to health risk factors and medical conditions. Just because two things happen together doesn’t mean one causes the other.\nIn health, many things can affect conditions. High rates of a health problem don’t mean one specific thing is the cause. It could be a mix of lifestyle, environment, and genetics. By looking at different risk factors and the health problem together, we can understand better and make good health choices for our community.\nJust like the rooster and the sun, health risk factors might be linked to certain conditions, but they don’t directly cause them. Knowing these links helps us create better health plans with our communities. By looking at our community’s health using different types of data, we can understand the factors, find opportunities, and make strategies that fit our local needs.

    "section": "Data Terms/Definitions",
    "text": "Data Terms/Definitions\n\nCount\n\nA count represents the value of an observation. Counts are useful for assessing the economic impact of a community and determining if statistical analysis is reliable. According to (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2024), counts less than 16 are considered unstable, meaning the results should be interpreted with caution. However, counts below 16 are still important because they provide us with a sense of how a community is currently doing. Counts shouldn’t be compared among different communities, but they can be used to assess the community.\n\n\n\nProportion\n\nA proportion is a type of ratio that compares a part to the whole. It is expressed as a fraction or percentage and helps us understand the relative size of a subset within a larger population. For example, if 20 out of 100 people in a community have a certain health condition, the proportion is 20%.\n\n\n\nCrude vs. Age-Adjusted Prevalence\n\nCrude Prevalence: Shows the overall condition in the general population but can be misleading if age distribution varies between communities. For example, an aging population may have a higher crude prevalence of heart disease simply because older adults can be more prone to this condition.\nAge-Adjusted Prevalence: Use this for comparing different communities as it accounts for age differences. It’s like comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges. By adjusting for age, we ensure a fair comparison between communities.\n\n\n\nImportance of Age-Adjusted Prevalence\nAge-adjusted prevalence allows fair comparisons by considering age differences in populations.\n\n\nConfidence Intervals (CI)\nCIs can be interpreted in two main ways.\n\nWhen looking at only one community.\n\nIf a community had a 95% CI of 5%-8%, this would mean we are 95% sure that the true number is as low as 5% and as high as 8% or somewhere in between.\n\nWhen comparing two communities.\n\nIf a community has a 95% CI of 5%-8% and another community has a 95% CI of 6%-9% for the same topic, these two communities are similar, and we cannot say one is definitely higher or lower than the other because the values overlap (6% falls between 5%-8%)\nIf a community has a 95% CI of 5%-8% and another community has a 95% CI of 10%-15%, these two communities would be significantly different because the values don’t overlap (5%-8% and 10%-15%) so we can say with 95% confidence that these values are different.",

It covers a broad range of topics, including physical activity, nutrition, substance use, mental health, school safety, relationships, sexual activity, and positive behaviors, as well as connections to family, school, and community.\nMost school districts in Minnesota participate in the MSS. Although there was a drop in participation statewide in 2022 and some schools or specific grades in Kittson, Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, and Roseau Counties did not take part in the 2022 survey. We strongly encourage all schools in these counties to join the upcoming 2025 MSS.\nThe results of the MSS are crucial for incorporating the perspectives of young people into policy-making, program development, and service provision for students.

    "text": "Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)\nSocial vulnerability describes the potential adverse effects on communities from external stresses on human health, such as natural or human-made disasters and disease outbreaks. Mitigating social vulnerability can reduce both human suffering and economic losses. The CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) organizes fifteen census-derived factors into four themes to measure an area’s social vulnerability. These factors include economic data, education, family characteristics, housing, language proficiency, ethnicity, and vehicle access. The SVI scale ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the highest vulnerability. The Healthy People 2030 initiative focuses on enhancing social and community support. By working together, partners can ideally offer services and resources that help achieve a low vulnerability status.\nKittson County has approximately 690 individuals below poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 226 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated 118 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Kittson County has about 177 uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 1,101 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 26 households have more people than rooms available.\nKittson County Interpretation: Kittson County’s high score in the Housing Type and Transportation category suggests that these are significant areas of concern. Despite the overall low social vulnerability score, the high index in this category highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve housing conditions and transportation access. Addressing these issues can help reduce the overall vulnerability of the community and improve residents’ quality of life.\nMarshall County has approximately 1,361 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 621 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated 467 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Marshall County also has about 365 uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 2,003 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 43 households have more people than rooms available.\nMarshall County Interpretation: Marshall County has an overall low social vulnerability index, but there are significant concerns regarding household characteristics. The high score in household characteristics indicates that many residents face challenges related to family structure, disability, and single-parent households. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the overall well-being of the community.\nPennington County approximately has 2,178 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 1,306 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated456 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Pennington County also has about 436 uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 2,581 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 68 households have more people than rooms available.\nPennington County Interpretation: Pennington County has a low to medium overall social vulnerability, with the highest score in the housing type and transportation category. This high score underscores the need for focused interventions in this area. By addressing these specific vulnerabilities, Pennington County can work towards enhancing the well-being and resilience of its residents.\nRed Lake County has approximately 670 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 296 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated136 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Red Lake County also has about 108 uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 852 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 33 households have more people than rooms available.\nRed Lake County Interpretation: Red Lake County exhibits low overall social vulnerability, with the highest score in the household characteristics category. This indicates a need for targeted interventions in this area. By addressing these specific vulnerabilities, Red Lake County can improve the well-being and resilience of its residents.\nRoseau County has approximately 2,365 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 1,179 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated742 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Roseau County also has about 728uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 2,788 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 62 households have more people than rooms available.\nRoseau County Interpretation: Roseau County exhibits medium to high overall social vulnerability, with all categories except racial and ethnic minority status falling into the medium to high-risk range. The scores for socioeconomic status, household characteristics, and housing type/transportation highlight areas that could benefit from focused efforts. These aspects emphasize the value of targeted interventions to enhance the well-being and resilience of Roseau County’s residents. By addressing these specific challenges, the county can work towards creating a more supportive and sustainable community.\nThe SVI project is an excellent starting point for identifying areas to invest in related to socioeconomic factors (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/ Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program 2022).

The absence of these colors suggests that there have been no areas with extremely high crash rates or severe injuries, reflecting effective traffic safety measures and safer roads. Marshall and Pennington counties are the only counties among the five that recorded three deaths or serious injuries (dark orange) within their borders; Pennington County had this occur in multiple locations. Minnesota Toward Zero Deaths (TZD) is the state’s leading traffic safety program, using an interdisciplinary approach to reduce traffic crashes, injuries, and fatalities on Minnesota roads.

    "text": "Housing Insecurity\nHousing instability is a pressing issue that affects countless individuals and families. It includes a spectrum of challenges such as struggling to pay rent, living in overcrowded conditions, frequent relocations, and the looming threat of eviction. These hardships can deeply impact physical and mental health, educational success, and overall well-being. Tackling housing insecurity is vital for fostering stable, healthy communities and ensuring everyone has a safe, affordable place to call home.\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of housing insecurity reveals some variations across our counties and the state of Minnesota. In Minnesota, the prevalence is 10.4% (CI: 9.3-11.7%), while the Quin CHS region has a slightly higher rate at 10.6% (CI: 9.3-12.0%). Among the counties, Kittson has a prevalence of 9.4% (CI: 8.3-10.8%), Marshall stands at 10.7% (CI: 9.4-12.2%), Pennington at 11.0% (CI: 9.6-12.4%), Red Lake at 10.5% (CI: 9.2-11.9%), and Roseau at 10.5% (CI: 9.3-11.9%). While these figures show some differences, the overlapping confidence intervals suggest that these variations are not statistically significant.

    "text": "Healthcare and Dental Access\nAccess to comprehensive health care, including primary and dental care, is crucial for overall well-being. Primary care providers detect, prevent, and manage health conditions through check-ups, immunizations, chronic disease management, and specialist coordination. Dental services are essential for preventing and treating oral health issues, which affect overall health. Regular check-ups and cleanings prevent cavities and gum disease, while dentists educate on good oral hygiene. Improving access to these services can lead to better health outcomes for our communities. Efforts to increase the availability of primary care providers and dentists, especially in underserved regions, are crucial. This includes initiatives to attract and retain healthcare professionals in rural areas, expanding telehealth services, and ensuring affordable care for all residents. Increasing access to comprehensive, high-quality health care is a Healthy People 2030 Goal.\nPopulation per Primary Care Provider (2022) - Minnesota: 1,133 people per primary care provider.\n\nKittson County: Data not available (NA)\nMarshall County: 8,988 people per primary care provider\nPennington County: 1,252 people per primary care provider\nRed Lake County: Data not available (NA)\nRoseau County: 1,907 people per primary care provider\n\nPennington County has the closest average to the state of Minnesota, with 1,252 people per primary care provider compared to the state average of 1,133 people per provider.

Marshall County has the highest ratio among the counties with available data, with 8,988 people per provider, suggesting significantly less access to primary care services.

Marshall County has the highest ratio among the counties with available data, with 4,430 people per dentist, suggesting significantly less access to dental services. Data for Red Lake County is not available.\nDespite potentially less access to primary care providers, the estimated rate of routine checkups is similar to the Minnesota state average, with about 3 out of 4 people predicted to get their checkups.

    "section": "Rate of Natural Increase",
    "text": "Rate of Natural Increase\nThe birth rate and death rate are fundamental demographic indicators that provide insights into the population dynamics of a region. The birth rate measures the number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year, while the death rate measures the number of deaths per 1,000 people in the same period. The difference between these two rates is known as the natural increase (or decrease, if deaths exceed births), which indicates the growth or decline of a population excluding migration.\nNatural increase is a crucial component of population change, but it does not account for the movement of people into or out of a region. Migration can significantly impact population size and composition, often overshadowing natural increase. For instance, a region with a high birth rate and low death rate might still experience population decline if a large number of people move away. Conversely, areas with low natural increase might grow rapidly due to high levels of immigration.\nIn 2020, four out of the five Quin counties experienced a natural decrease, likely due to the impact of COVID-19. The pandemic significantly influenced both birth and death rates, with increased mortality and potential delays in births due to economic and health uncertainties. Kittson County saw the most notable natural decrease, with a rate of -13.1, the highest among the Quin counties. Roseau County had the second largest natural decrease, with a rate of -3.8, marking a significant shift from previous years. Marshall County and Pennington County both experienced a natural decrease of -1.2, a change from the generally positive natural increase observed in previous years. Red Lake County was the only Quin county to have a natural increase in 2020, with a rate of 3.2, continuing the trend of positive natural increase seen in prior years (Minnesota Department of Health 2015-2020).\nLooking ahead,\nWith the significant impact COVID-19 had on communities and the lag in this data (new data should be available in Q1 2025), it is challenging to predict the lasting effects of the pandemic. It will be crucial to monitor these trends and implement measures to mitigate the long-term impacts. Public health initiatives, economic support, and healthcare improvements could help stabilize and improve the natural increase rates in these counties. Prior to the COVID-19, Kittson County has seen a natural decrease, highlighting the need for targeted public health interventions and policies to support population growth and health in Kittson County.\n\nKittson County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n8.8\n12.9\n-4.1\n2015\n\n\n8.1\n12.9\n-4.8\n2016\n\n\n15.1\n18.1\n-3.1\n2017\n\n\n12.5\n13.4\n-0.9\n2018\n\n\n10.5\n14\n-3.5\n2019\n\n\n7.6\n20.6\n-13.1\n2020\n\n\n\n\nMarshall County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n13.3\n9.7\n3.6\n2015\n\n\n11.4\n9.7\n1.7\n2016\n\n\n14\n8.9\n5.1\n2017\n\n\n14.5\n10.5\n4\n2018\n\n\n8.6\n8.7\n-0.1\n2019\n\n\n10.4\n11.6\n-1.2\n2020\n\n\n\n\nPennington County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n13.3\n8.7\n4.6\n2015\n\n\n11.9\n8.7\n3.2\n2016\n\n\n11.9\n9.9\n2\n2017\n\n\n11.8\n9.9\n1.9\n2018\n\n\n10.6\n10.2\n0.4\n2019\n\n\n8.9\n10.1\n-1.2\n2020\n\n\n\n\nRed Lake County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n11.6\n6.2\n5.4\n2015\n\n\n10.5\n6.2\n4.3\n2016\n\n\n10.2\n7.9\n2.2\n2017\n\n\n10.8\n9.8\n1\n2018\n\n\n11.3\n8.9\n2.5\n2019\n\n\n10.9\n7.7\n3.2\n2020\n\n\n\n\nRoseau County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n11.6\n8.8\n2.9\n2015\n\n\n11.5\n8.8\n2.8\n2016\n\n\n11.5\n9.3\n2.3\n2017\n\n\n11.4\n8.3\n3.1\n2018\n\n\n10.7\n10\n0.7\n2019\n\n\n9.1\n13\n-3.8\n2020",

Prescription rates allow for comparisons between counties. Among the five counties, Marshall County was the only one to see a slight increase in the prescription rate per 1,000 residents during this period.\nSeveral factors can influence changes in prescription rates and why one county may have higher rates than another. These factors include population demographics (such as older populations with higher chronic pain conditions), access to healthcare, variations in healthcare provider prescribing practices, and public health initiatives. A high prescription rate in a county is not necessarily a bad thing; rather, it provides an opportunity to communicate with our local partners to further understand if the prescription rates accurately reflect the needs of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Minnesota Board of Pharmacy (2022-2023)\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Prescription Rate per 1,000 Residents",

This high ratio is also reflected in the Minnesota Student Survey responses from 9th grade students, with about 1 in every 3 to 5 reporting feeling down, depressed, or hopeless over the past two weeks for Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, and Roseau. The most recent available data for Kittson County is 2019 and the results are about 1 in every 3 students feeling depressed. In 2022, Red Lake County had the highest percentage of 9th graders responding ‘yes’ to this question, with a significant increase from 18.5% in 2019 to 32.0% in 2022. Conversely, Pennington County saw a decrease in this sentiment, from 25.0% in 2019 to 20.8% in 2022.\nRecent data highlights a concerning trend in the well-being of our youth, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced support and access to services. In Marshall and Red Lake counties, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of 9th graders who felt their community cared about them “quite a bit” or “very much” from 2019 to 2022. This decline in perceived community support is alarming, as it is a crucial factor in the overall mental health and well-being of young people. Additionally, Kittson, Marshall, Pennington, and Roseau counties lag significantly behind the state of Minnesota in early screening rates for mental health and depression in patients aged 12-17. Early screening plays a vital role in identifying and addressing mental health issues promptly, leading to better outcomes for youth. The consistency between the decline in community support and the low rates of early mental health screening suggests a broader issue: our youth need more comprehensive support systems. A very encouraging sign is even with not feeling supported by the local community and not being screened early, the youth in Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, and Roseau have similar percetages with respect to their county in students self-reporting not using alcohol, marijuana, or drugs within the last year.\nRecent data highlights a concerning trend in the well-being of our youth, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced support and access to services.
