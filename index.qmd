# Introduction

The Quin County Community Health Board (Quin CHB), governed by five members, is a multi-county community health services (CHS) entity responsible for providing local governmental public health services. Through delegation and sharing agreements, all powers and duties are delegated to the health departments of Kittson County Public Health, Marshall County Public Health, Pennington-Red Lake County Public Health, and Roseau County Public Health. We are pleased to share the 2023-2025 preliminary Community Health Assessment (CHA) to gain deeper insights into the health challenges affecting these communities..

Quin CHB is going to utilized an adapted version of the Community Health Improvement Framework, "Mobilizing Action for Planning and Partnership" (MAPP), to collect information and create a Community Health Assessment (CHA) that highlights the most critical health needs within the service area. The data collection process faced limitations due to the availability of county-level data, community input, survey responses, and time constraints. This framework facilitated structured and focused discussions, incorporating data analysis, participant feedback, potential solutions, and agreed-upon future strategies among community health partners.

The CHA findings are instrumental in pinpointing, developing, and targeting strategies to address health challenges within the community. Guided by public health leaders and strategists, this framework, combined with Results Based Accountability, enables communities to apply strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify community-driven solutions and resources for collective action. The Community Health Assessment is designed to be a living document, updated as new data becomes available. We encourage using this assessment as a foundation for understanding our communities' health, enhancing well-being, and planning for the future.
