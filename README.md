# CHA_Quin

### Project Overview
This repository serves as a centralized location for data, documentation, and analysis related to Community Health Assessments (CHA) for Kittson, Marshall, Pennington, Red Lake, and Roseau counties in Minnesota. It is designed to support public health professionals, community organizations, and stakeholders in understanding and addressing local health needs.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide accessible and organized data that informs planning, decision-making, and implementation of health improvement strategies. By consolidating relevant data and resources, this repository aims to enhance collaboration and transparency in community health efforts.
### Data Sources
Data included in this repository may come from:

⦁	Minnesota Department of Health

⦁	County-level health surveys and assessments

⦁	Minnesota Student Survey

⦁	Hospital and emergency room visit records

⦁	Public health reports and briefs

### Usage
Users can explore the repository to:

⦁	Review health indicators and trends

⦁	Access summaries and visualizations

⦁	Support grant writing and strategic planning

⦁	Inform community outreach and education efforts

### Data Transparency and Reproducibility
We tried our best to use the most up-to-date publicly available data for the following reasons:

⦁	Reproducibility: While some data for our CHA required a data request, most of the report relies on publicly available data. This allows other community health boards and researchers to reproduce our work if they wish, aiding in fact-checking.

⦁	Transparency: Using publicly available data allows us to be as transparent as possible.

⦁	Efficiency: By using publicly available data, we can save time and resources for our federal and state data stewards.
